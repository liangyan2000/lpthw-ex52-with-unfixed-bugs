learn python the hard way (by zed shaw) ex52 my attempts

I've been <<learning python the hard way>> by myself relying on this Zed A. Shaw book.
It was smooth sailing till ex50 and I finally managed to reach ex52, the last one, 
  about a web-based text-input style game "Gothonweb".
The game can run but there are (at least) several bugs in the 
  planisphere.py and app.py files, 
  which I can hardly understand why or fix.
Especially in \gothonweb\planisphere.py, 
  there is a "***" that trys to catch all wrong answers,
  it doesn't work and I can't find a way to make it work.
  
 I posted it here to ask for help and if that is too much to ask, to remind the future me 
  that there are still unfixed bugs but I need to move on
  and I will be back :)
